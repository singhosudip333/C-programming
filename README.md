# C Programming Repository

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of basic C programming codes and algorithms. It serves as a resource for learning and understanding fundamental programming concepts and algorithm implementations in C.

## Available Codes and Algorithms

The following codes and algorithms are available in this repository:

### Basic C Programs

- **Hello World**: A simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
- **Basic Calculator**: A program that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- **Factorial**: A program that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion.
- **Fibonacci Series**: A program that generates the Fibonacci series up to a specified number.
- **Prime Number Checker**: A program that checks if a number is prime.

### Algorithms

- **Sorting Algorithms**:
  - **Bubble Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
  - **Selection Sort**: An in-place comparison sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: a sorted and an unsorted part.
  - **Insertion Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.

- **Searching Algorithms**:
  - **Linear Search**: A method for finding a target value within a list by checking each element in sequence.
  - **Binary Search**: A more efficient algorithm for finding a target value in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

- **Recursion Examples**:
  - **Tower of Hanoi**: A classic problem that involves moving disks between three pegs.
  - **Binary Search (Recursive)**: A recursive implementation of the binary search algorithm.

## Installation

To get started with the projects in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/singhosudip333/C-programming.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd C-programming
   ```

3. Compile the C files using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc`):
   ```bash
   gcc -o output_file_name source_file.c
   ```

## Usage

To run the compiled program, use the following command:
```bash
./output_file_name
```
Replace `output_file_name` with the name of your compiled executable.
